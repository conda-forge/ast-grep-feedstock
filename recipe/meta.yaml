  description: |
    ast-grep is an AST-based tool to search code by pattern code. Think it as
    your old-friend grep but it matches AST nodes instead of text. You can
    write patterns as if you are writing ordinary code. It will match all code
    that has the same syntactical structure. You can use $ sign + upper case
    letters as wildcard, e.g. $MATCH, to match any single AST node. Think it as
    REGEX dot ., except it is not textual.
